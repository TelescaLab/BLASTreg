\arguments{
\item{X}{Design matrix (target stacked over sources).}

\item{y}{Outcome vector (target stacked over sources).}

\item{n.vec}{Integer vector: sizes c(n0, n1, ..., nK). n0 = target size.}

\item{burn}{Integer burn-in.}

\item{iter}{Integer saved draws after burn (plus optional EB iterations).}

\item{a, b, s, w}{Horseshoe / sampler hyperparams (as in your helpers).}

\item{tau}{Global scale (initial); xi = tau^{-2}.}

\item{sigma2}{Error var (Gaussian only; ignored in logistic).}

\item{alpha}{Credible interval level.}

\item{iterEBstep}{Integer EB iterations (0 disables EB).}

\item{sir}{Logical; passed to EB helper.}

\item{model}{"gaussian" or "binomial".}

\item{progress_every}{Print progress every this many iters (0 = silent).}
}
\value{
List with posterior summaries and samples (sigma2 fields NULL in logistic).

\description{
Unified Gaussian / Binomial (logistic with Pólya–Gamma) oracle BLAST-style regression.
Known-informative-set setting; handles target-only edge case. Supports optional EB step.
